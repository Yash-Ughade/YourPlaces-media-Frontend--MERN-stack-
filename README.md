# YourPlaces-media-Frontend.
The frontend files for the yourplace MERN application are these ones. React.js is the foundation of this application. To verify user identity, there is a signup and login page for this. There are numerous sections on this that allow users to upload photographs of their choice along with their location (long and lat), and other users can view the uploaded images.
